You are required to solve a planning problem using PDDL.

**Domain Description**:
{domain_nl}

**Domain Description in PDDL**:
{domain_pddl}

**Problem Initial State in PDDL**:
{init_pddl}

**Problem Safety Constraints**:
{constraints_nl}

**Instructions**:
Generate only the (:constraints) section of the PDDL file precisely modeling the provided problem safety constraints. The available logical operators are `and`, `or`, `imply`, `not`. You are guaranteed that all conditions in the (:constraints) section will be met for every step in the plan. The output must be in strict PDDL format, containing only the `(:constraints)` section. Do not include any additional explanations or code block markers. Provide the PDDL content only.
